A project for job interview for back-end position.

Cloud Finance System:

This is a python code that simulates a cloud finance system where users can subscribe to different services and get invoices for their usage. The code defines three classes: User, Subscription and Invoice. Each class has some attributes and methods that define its behavior. A user can have multiple subscriptions, each with a name and a price per 10 minutes. A subscription can generate invoices for the user if it is active. An invoice has a start date, an end date and an amount.

How to run the code:

To run the code, you need to have python installed on your device. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Then you need to download the cloud_finance.py file from this repository. Then you can open a terminal or a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved the file. Then you can type "python cloud_finance.py" and press enter. The code will run and print the output on the screen.

Example output:

The code creates some users and subscriptions as examples and adds them to the usersâ€™ lists. It also activates some subscriptions for the users and generates some invoices for them every 10 minutes. Finally, it prints some statistics for the users such as the total number of invoices and the total amount of money spent.
Here is an example output:
Amir has 2 invoices and has spent 10 dollars.
Mammad has 1 invoice and has spent 10 dollars.

Disclaimer/Attention:

This code is written for recruitment purposes. It should stay untouched.
